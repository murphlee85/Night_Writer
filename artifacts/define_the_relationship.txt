Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project?

Overall, each group member's expectations of what the experience programming in a group will likely consist of.  We're all excited to learn and work with one another and see how things goes.

Goals and expectations:
1.  Finish the project early (70%/30%).
2.  Have the paired programming experience and individually what went well and what didn't go so well.
3.  Show up on time, if not within 15 to 20 minutes of the time expected.
4.  Meeting in the mornings seems the best schedule to set for everyone's needs.
